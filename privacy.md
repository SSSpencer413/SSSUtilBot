This utility bot (the "Bot") respects your privacy and is committed to protecting the data it processes. This Privacy Policy explains what information is collected, how it is used, and your rights regarding your data when interacting with the Bot on Discord.

## 1. Information the Bot Collects
The Bot collects minimal information to function. This includes:

- User-provided content: Images uploaded for processing via image editing commands.
- User messages and interactions: Commands sent to the Bot, such as /count, /memeify, and others, are temporarily logged to execute the requested action.

## 2. How the Information Is Used
The Bot processes data only to provide the requested services. 

## 3. Data Storage
The Bot does not store any data long-term. All images, messages, and commands are processed in real-time and are deleted after fulfilling the user's request. No personal data is saved beyond the immediate interaction.

## 4. User Responsibilities
You are responsible for ensuring that any content you upload via the Bot, such as images, does not contain sensitive, personal, or illegal material. By using the Bot, you confirm that you have the necessary rights and permissions for any images you upload.

## 5. Data Security
While no system is completely secure, the Bot uses reasonable technical and organizational measures to protect the limited data it processes. Since data is only handled temporarily, the risk of exposure is minimized.

## 6. Children's Privacy
The Bot is not intended for use by anyone under the age of 13. If you are under 13, please refrain from using the Bot.

## 7. Your Rights
As the Bot does not store any data beyond the real-time processing of commands and images, there is no retained personal information to request access to, modify, or delete. If you have concerns about how your data is processed, please stop using the Bot.

## 8. Changes to This Policy
The Bot owner may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. It is your responsibility to review the policy regularly. Continued use of the Bot after changes indicates acceptance of the updated Privacy Policy.
